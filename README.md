# GroupProj

## Description

In this project, Whit, Dillon, and Amber collaborated to create a website where you can "like" a dog that will be put up for an adoption. We used a dog fact web API and a random dog picture for the user to "like". For this project we used Bulma for most of our styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## Installation

The project just needs to be deployed from the website.

## Usage

## Credits

Thanks, per usual, to the Calendely tutors, our TA, and our instructor, but mostly to our team for extra efforts in and out of class.
