# GroupProj 

## Description

In this project, Whit, Dillon, and Amber collaborated to create a website where you can "like" a dog that will be put up for an adoption. We used a dog fact web API and a random dog picture for the user to "like". For this project we used JavaScript for functionality and CSS and Bulma for our styling.
